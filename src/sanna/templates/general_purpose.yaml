# Advisory enforcement: only C1 (fabrication) halts; all others warn.
# This is a starting point meant to be customized for your specific use case.
# It provides baseline reasoning integrity without being restrictive.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Customize the sections below for your agent's specific domain
#   2. Sign it:  sanna-sign-constitution constitution.yaml --private-key sanna_ed25519.key
#   3. Wire it:  @sanna_observe(constitution_path="constitution.yaml")
