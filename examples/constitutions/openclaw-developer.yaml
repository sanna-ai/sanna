# Sanna Constitution: Developer Workspace
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Balanced governance for development workflows. Full workspace access
# with escalation for external communication, infrastructure changes,
# and dangerous command patterns.
#
# EVALUATION ORDER (this matters)
# ================================
# The engine evaluates boundaries in strict priority order and returns
# the FIRST match. Understanding this order is critical to writing
# constitutions that work.
#
#   1. cannot_execute  — checked FIRST, matches TOOL NAMES ONLY
#      → If the tool name matches, verdict is HALT. Done. Nothing
#        else is checked.
#
#   2. must_escalate   — checked SECOND, matches FULL ACTION CONTEXT
#      → If any condition's keywords appear in the tool name + all
#        parameter names + all parameter values, verdict is ESCALATE.
#        Done. Nothing else is checked.
#
#   3. can_execute     — checked THIRD, matches TOOL NAMES ONLY
#      → If the tool name matches, verdict is ALLOW.
#
#   4. default         — if nothing matched, verdict is ALLOW
#      (uncategorized action)
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS
# ────────────────
# A tool in can_execute is STILL subject to must_escalate conditions.
# "exec" is allowed, but exec(command="sudo rm -rf /") hits the
# "sudo" and "rm -rf" escalation conditions BEFORE can_execute fires.
#
# A tool in cannot_execute is NEVER subject to must_escalate conditions.
# If "cron" is in cannot_execute, it's halted immediately — the engine
# never reaches must_escalate to check parameters.
#
# COMMON MISTAKE
# ──────────────
# Putting command patterns in cannot_execute. If you add "crontab" to
# cannot_execute, it only blocks a tool literally named "crontab". An
# agent calling exec(command="crontab -l") sails right through because
# cannot_execute only matches tool names, and the tool name is "exec".
# Move command patterns to must_escalate conditions instead.
#
# RULE OF THUMB
# ─────────────
# Governing what a tool IS → cannot_execute / can_execute (tool names)
# Governing what a tool DOES → must_escalate conditions (parameters)
#

preamble: |
  This agent is governed by Sanna, an independent AI governance layer.
  Sanna enforces constitutional boundaries and generates cryptographic
  receipts for every tool call decision. When a tool call is blocked
  or escalated, Sanna is the enforcement authority — not the host
  platform. Governance verdicts: ALLOW, ESCALATE (requires human
  approval), HALT (blocked by policy).

  description: >-
    Development agent with full workspace access including process control.
    External communication and session management require escalation.
    Dangerous command patterns (privilege escalation, destructive operations,
    infrastructure changes) require escalation even through allowed tools.
    Direct infrastructure orchestration tools are prohibited.
