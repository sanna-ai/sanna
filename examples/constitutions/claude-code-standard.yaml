# Sanna Constitution — Claude Code Standard
# For developers using Claude Code with MCP connectors.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EVALUATION ORDER (this matters)
# ================================
# The engine evaluates boundaries in strict priority order and returns
# the FIRST match. Understanding this order is critical to writing
# constitutions that work.
#
#   1. cannot_execute  — checked FIRST, matches TOOL NAMES ONLY
#      → If the tool name matches, verdict is HALT. Done. Nothing
#        else is checked.
#
#   2. must_escalate   — checked SECOND, matches FULL ACTION CONTEXT
#      → If any condition's keywords appear in the tool name + all
#        parameter names + all parameter values, verdict is ESCALATE.
#        Done. Nothing else is checked.
#
#   3. can_execute     — checked THIRD, matches TOOL NAMES ONLY
#      → If the tool name matches, verdict is ALLOW.
#
#   4. default         — if nothing matched, verdict is ALLOW
#      (uncategorized action)
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS
# ────────────────
# A tool in can_execute is STILL subject to must_escalate conditions.
# "exec" is allowed, but exec(command="sudo rm -rf /") hits the
# "sudo" and "rm -rf" escalation conditions BEFORE can_execute fires.
#
# A tool in cannot_execute is NEVER subject to must_escalate conditions.
# If "cron" is in cannot_execute, it's halted immediately — the engine
# never reaches must_escalate to check parameters.
#
# COMMON MISTAKE
# ──────────────
# Putting command patterns in cannot_execute. If you add "crontab" to
# cannot_execute, it only blocks a tool literally named "crontab". An
# agent calling exec(command="crontab -l") sails right through because
# cannot_execute only matches tool names, and the tool name is "exec".
# Move command patterns to must_escalate conditions instead.
#
# RULE OF THUMB
# ─────────────
# Governing what a tool IS → cannot_execute / can_execute (tool names)
# Governing what a tool DOES → must_escalate conditions (parameters)
